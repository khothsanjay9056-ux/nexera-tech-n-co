## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Facebook Ads:
1. **Use video ads** - Even a simple slideshow performs better
2. **Test different images** - Try dashboard screenshots, office photos, results
3. **Run A/B tests** - Test 3 versions of each ad
4. **Engage with comments** - Reply to every comment quickly
5. **Use lead forms** - Facebook's built-in forms convert better than landing pages

### Google Ads:
1. **Start with phrase match** keywords, not broad match
2. **Add negative keywords weekly** (e.g., "free", "jobs", "course")
3. **Use ad extensions** - Sitelinks, callouts, call extensions
4. **Focus on mobile** - Most searches are mobile now
5. **Bid on competitor names** (if budget allows)

### Both Platforms:
1. **Start small** - Better to run fewer ads well than many ads poorly
2. **Be patient** - Need 100+ clicks per ad to know if it works
3. **Track phone calls** - Use tracking numbers to measure all leads
4. **Respond fast** - Reply to leads within 1 hour (5x higher conversion)
5. **Test, test, test** - Always be testing new ad copy and targeting
